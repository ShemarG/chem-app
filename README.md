# chem-app

### Background
**chem-app** was created in late 2016 to help me memorize Polyatomic Ions for my freshman CHEM 10301 class at CCNY. <br>
This is the project that marks the beginning of my little hobby of solving small problems with my web development skills. <br>
The first version was writted with basic HTML/CSS/JS with some help from JQuery. I've since developed my skillset and reworte it in Vue. <br>
<br>

### Usage
The app generates the name of a random polyatomic ion from a preset list. You must correctly enter it's chemical formula and its charge, after which another name appears. It also keeps track of your score and streak.

It is currently live on Heroku at this link: https://chem-app.herokuapp.com/
