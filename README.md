# chem-app

### Background
**chem-app** was created in late 2016 to help me memorize Polyatomic Ions for my freshman CHEM 10301 class at CCNY. <br>
This is the project that marks the beginning of my little hobby of solving small problems with my web development skills. <br>
The first version was writted with basic HTML/CSS/JS with some help from JQuery. I've since developed my skillset and reworte it in Vue. <br>
